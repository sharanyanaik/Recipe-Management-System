            And Pinch of Yum is my little corner of the internet!
            <br><br>
           <p>I'm the voice, author, and creator behind Pinch of Yum. What started as a
            casual hobby over 14 years ago in 2010 while I was working as a fourth
            grade teacher has now grown into a full-blown business (!!) that reaches
            millions of people with fun recipes each month, with content that has
            been featured on The Kitchn, CNN, Refinery29,POPSUGAR,
            Huffington Post, The Everymom, PureWow, and more.</p> 
           <p> I live in Saint Paul, MN with my husband Bjork and our dog Sage. 
            always been to make cooking a joyful experience for everyone, whether you're a seasoned 
            chef or just starting out in the kitchen.</p> 
            <p>Throughout the years, my work has been featured on some of the most popular platforms, including The Kitchn, CNN, Refinery29, Brit + Co, POPSUGAR, Huffington Post, The Everymom, PureWow, and many more. These opportunities have allowed me to connect with a broader audience and shar
                e not only recipes but also stories, tips, and inspirations that have shaped my culinary journey.</p>
